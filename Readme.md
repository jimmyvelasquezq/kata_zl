Feature 1 - Playing Bingo
To get the best reach for our Bingo game, we are going to model it on the US version to begin with. To make this
work, we are going to need to be able to call out numbers, generate Bingo cards for people to play with, and check
their cards when someone calls Bingo. Once we have got these basics in place, we can then start to add new features
or tweak the way it works.
